Taylor Swift Song Ranking Software
Throughout the code there are many comments for specific code and what it is. 
There is also bunches of commented out code in specific places for things that do not work but are just there for reference.
Only the rank.html, index.html and style.css are working and used files for the working part of the software. The rest of the files are mostly commented out or just do not work/affect the software at all.
